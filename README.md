# psalterium
Psalmen, Hymnen, Antiphonen f√ºr das zisterziensische Offizium der Ferialtage
Some of the work we've been doing in Helfta in order to create a new Breviarium with the old latin Hymns and Antiphons.
You'll find gabc-files to create scores with the gregorio-programm as well as tex-files to create pdfs. 
Please be careful when using the tex-files: many of them aren't updatet to the newest version of gregorio.
